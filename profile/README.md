# 🚀 UIU CanSat Team

Welcome to the official GitHub organization of **UIU CanSat**, a student-driven aerospace and satellite technology initiative under **United International University (UIU)**.

We design, build, and test miniature satellite systems — known as **CanSats** — to simulate real-world space missions and compete in national and international CanSat competitions.


## 📡 About CanSat

A **CanSat** is a type of mini satellite integrated within the volume and shape of a soft drink can. The mission is to perform a space-type mission in a small form factor, including:

- Atmospheric sensing
- Telemetry communication
- Descent control
- Autonomous system operations


## 🛰️ Our Mission

> *"To inspire and equip the next generation of space engineers through hands-on CanSat development and real-world aerospace challenges."*


## 🧠 What We Do

- Design and simulate satellite systems  
- Develop embedded software and ground control systems  
- Work with sensors, radio communication, and flight control  
- Participate in competitions and research in aerospace technologies  
- Collaborate on multidisciplinary engineering challenges
